# Forest Fire Modeling Project ðŸŒ³ðŸ”¥

This repository contains a project that models the spread of forest fires using a combination of computational and analytical methods.

---

### Project Contents

* `forest_fire_model.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive overview of the project. It includes a Python implementation for modeling forest fire spread in **one and two dimensions**, along with a specific example of how **firefighters can be added** to the simulation to control the spread.
* `analytical_solution.tex`: This LaTeX file contains the **analytical solution for the critical behavior of one-dimensional forest fires**.
* `analytical_solution.pdf`: The compiled PDF version of the LaTeX document, providing a clear and readable explanation of the analytical solution.
* `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, which provides a guide to the project.
